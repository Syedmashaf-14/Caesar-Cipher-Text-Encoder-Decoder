## Caesar-Cipher-Text-Encoder-Decoder
This Python program provides a simple and interactive way to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique based on letter shifting.
## âœ¨ Features
Encryption: Shift letters forward in the alphabet to encrypt a message.
Decryption: Reverse the shift to reveal the original text.
Menu-Driven Interface: Intuitive command-line menu for user-friendly interaction.
Case-Insensitive Input: Automatically converts input to lowercase for consistency.

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
Each character in the input string is checked against the alphabet.
If found, it's shifted by the user-defined value (shift) and replaced accordingly.
Decryption reverses this process by shifting letters backward.
